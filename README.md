# MarineMatch
 MarineMatch is an app built in Android Studio in the Java language which uses image classification for users to identify 60+ different types of ocean animals and fish species

 The core functionality of MarineMatch is its image recognition algorithm, utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN). When a user takes a photo of a fish, the app processes the image almost instantaneously, identifying the species with high accuracy. The app then 
 provides information about the species, including its conservation status, helping fishers make informed decisions.
